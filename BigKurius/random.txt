Privacy is dead, and social media hold the smoking gun.
Digital freedom stops where that of users begins...
Without privacy, there is no point in being an individual.
In the next three years, the value of data will increase, making it even more valuable than it is today. The more efficiently you store your data, the more benefits your business will see.
Have you looked at my profile description? There is a little suprise.
Do you really believe you will reach me with your current skill sets? Maybe in a million years... if you are lucky.
Do you know how I found out about you? If it’s on the internet, it isn’t private.
I know! By infiltrating in that database once to release the private records, I might have made a few casualties. There would have been more victims if I wouldn't have done that.
I'm bored! Show me something interesting for once.
Want a hint? The password for that superuser is "imincontrol". See what I did there?
At one point I thought changing my name might help with privacy, but that was before the internet.
Good try, but not good enough.
