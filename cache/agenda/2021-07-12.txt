Loneliness is just the hardest and most unhappy feeling. And you feel lost, unable to find your way, too. You sound as though you are buried in sadness, and that's a heavy load to carry around.

Perhaps it would help if you understood what is going on with you, and to know that in many ways you are having feelings that are common in teens. In other words, you are not alone.

The teen years are a bridge between childhood and adulthood, and it is not unusual to feel that you are vascillating between them. During adolescence, teens begin to compare themselves with those around them, define their world, and consider where they fit into it. During this stage, many teens are trying to discover who they are and what their role is now and will be in the future. Introspection is a big part of being a teen, and this is clearly what you are experiencing now. It is a difficult process, and for many teens -- and not just for you -- itâ€™s often a lonely one.
