After work, I got an Uber to go home, since I was very tired after my productive workday, in which I successfully completed my list of tasks and avoided conversation with any other human, animal, plant or object.  I did not even talk to myself. My Uber driver was not a celebrity in disguise.  He was not a race-car driver in disguise.  He was not young or the hottest guy I had ever seen.  He was just a guy, who drove me home.  He did not speak to me.  I did not speak to him.
